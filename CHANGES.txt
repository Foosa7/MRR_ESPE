Changes
-------
v0.5
----
- Changed 74HCT595 footprint to TSSOP for better use of PCB space.
- Added PWR_SEL jumper to select between 12V and 24V for heated bed MOSFET gate.
- Added debounce capacitor to RESET button.
- Change VUSB_EN jumper to 5V_SEL jumper, to select between VUSB and VIN for 5V source.

v0.4
----
- Test version.
- 4 x 74HCT595 (32 outputs, TTL version running at VCC=5V):
  - 5 x stepper drivers (5 x 3 outputs = 15 outputs from lower 16 pins).
  - 74HCT595 for fan controls (3 outputs from upper 16 pins):
    - CONTROLLER_FAN, E0_AUTO_FAN, E1_AUTO_FAN
  - Jumpers to select between ESP32 and I2S pins (4 outputs from upper 16 pins):
    - Bed MOSFET
    - E0 MOSFET
    - Part-cooling fan
    - Beeper
  - Unused pin connector (10-pin).
- 2 x WST3392 for fan PWM control:
  - Part-cooling fan
  - CONTROLLER_FAN, E0_AUTO_FAN, E1_AUTO_FAN + jumpers for "always on" operation
- Total board layout revamp to allow 5 stepper drivers, with board size 102mm x 102mm.
- Changed power MOSFETs
  - WSK220N04 for Bed MOSFET.
  - WSF3085 for E0 MOSFET.
- Added T_EXT connector (IO34) for extra thermistor.
- Added VUSB_EN jumper to disable VUSB power.
- Added SD_EN jumper to select between onboard microSD card or external card.

v0.3
----
- Test version; 4 x 74HC595 instead of 2 x 74HC595; some of the additional I2S pins are connected to male headers for use in testing.
- Added pull-up resistors to MOTOR_EN pins.
- Changed endstop and thermistor connectors to JST XH.
- Changed TPS54340-related layout to take into consideration recommended PCB layout in data sheet.
- Changed pins to allow better ground plane under I2S to reduce noise.

v0.2
----
- Widened trace width of VBED-related traces.
- Changed F2 to use a bigger (Littelfuse 0456 series) 30A fuse.

v0.1
----
- Initial version.
- Changes from MRR_ESPA v1.0
  - Added 74HC595 to drive stepper motors.
  - Reorganized board layout
    - microSD card slot mounted on reverse side to free up additional footprint on top side.
  - Changed F2 to a bigger 30A fuse.
- Support for Creality LCD.
- Jumpers for TMC2130 SPI mode support
  - Breakout pins for X_CS, Y_CS, Z_CS, and E_CS which can then be connected with jumper wires to available pins.
