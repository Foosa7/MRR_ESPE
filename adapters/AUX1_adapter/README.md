# AUX1 adapter
## Fixes issue with AUX1 port on MRR ESPE v0.5

This adapter board fixes MRR ESPE v0.5's issue with the TX/RX pins being swapped on the AUX1 connector.

Simply use an IDC cable to connect AUX1_BRD to the AUX1 connector on the board. Then connect AUX1_SCRN to the screen (such as MKS TFT32).
