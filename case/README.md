# Cases for MRR ESPE

There are three versions:
1. Basic: Skeleton version, with a simple base, and a top that allows a 40mm fan to be fitted. Standoffs (at least 25mm; more if using stepper drivers with higher heat sinks) are needed.
2. Small: A small, almost enclosed case with a top that allows a 80mm fan to be fitted.
3. Normal: A slightly larger enclosed case, with two types of tops (either a 80mm fan, or two 40mm fans).

There are also covers for 40mm and 80mm fans.
